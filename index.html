    <h1>Monty Hall Probability</h1>
    <section class="about">
      <p>
        The Monty Hall problem is a famous paradoxical problem in conditional
        probability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the problem, you are on a game show, being asked to choose between
        three doors. Behind each door, there is either a car or a goat. You
        choose a door. The host, Monty Hall, picks one of the other doors, which
        he knows has a goat behind it and opens it, showing you the goat. (You
        know, by the rules of the game, that Monty will always reveal a goat.)
        Monty then asks whether you would like to switch your choice of door to
        the other remaining door. You prefer having a car more than having a
        goat. Do you choose to stick or switch?

          The program calculates the probability depending on the open-door
          event for the winning strategy between stick and switch. The minimum
          number of doors is 3. The difference between the total number of doors
          and the number of doors the host can open should be at least 2, to
          calculate probability between 2 doors. The program assumes that 1 of
          the doors is the user's choice.

      <h2>Statistics switching door the best option</h2>
      <p class="stitistics-about">
        Statistics based on the simulation a player chooses one door and the
        host opens all other doors except one. The statistics are based on the
        rules of the game, according to which Monty always reveals the goat.
        Repeated plays make it clearer why switching is the better strategy. The
        result of the best <b>stick</b> vs <b>switch</b> option depends on the
        frequency of choosing the right door.
