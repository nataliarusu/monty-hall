    <h1>Monty Hall Probability</h1>
    <div class="about">
      <p>The Monty Hall problem is a famous paradoxical problem in conditional
      probability.</p><p>In the problem, you are on a game show, being asked to choose
      between three doors. Behind each door, there is either a car or a goat.
      You choose a door. The host, Monty Hall, picks one of the other doors,
      which he knows has a goat behind it and opens it, showing you the goat.
      (You know, by the rules of the game, that Monty will always reveal a
      goat.) Monty then asks whether you would like to switch your choice of
      door to the other remaining door. You prefer having a car more than having
      a goat. Do you choose to stick or switch? </p><p>The Monty Hall problem
      famously embarrassed a large number of mathematicians with doctorate
      degrees when they attempted to "correct" Marilyn Vos Savant's solution <b>switch</b> in
      a column in Parade Magazine. This program demonstrates that Vos Savant is right and helps to understand why switching
      will let you win twice as often as sticking with the initial choice.</p>

          The program calculates the probability of the winning strategy between
          stick and switch. The minimum number of doors is 3. The difference
          between the total number of doors and the number of doors the host can
          open should be at least 2, to simulate probability between 2 doors.
          The program assumes that 1 of the doors is the user's choice.
